1.Explaination of jdk,jre,jvm
 jdk:java developement kit
 jdk contain jre and developement tools
 jdk helps during the compilation of program
 
 jre:java runtime emvironment
 jre contains jvm and set of libraries
 it will load the bite code,verify the byte code,run the byte code
 
 jvm:java virtual machine 
 tasks:
	Loads the byte code 
	Verifies the byte code
	Execute the byte code

	To call jvm we use it to compile the programme.
	jvm provide run time and perform the code to get the message or out put.
    
	
	
	

2.1.Explain following:
	 Class:Design which contain state and behavior
	 Object:Instance of class
	 purpose is to create  multiple copy of class
	 Static:Access modifier
	 Public:
	 Private:
	 keyword:Pre-defined values by the java compiler
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
 
2.2.public static void main(String args[])
Its a main method in the java contains sub parts as:
	
Public static :accaess specifiers/modifiers 
Their is also private
Static:non accaess modifiers
Void:return type(anything beyond)
Strings a[]:parameters
Main :method name(jvm is looking for main)



	

2.3.What is array
 Its a container which used to store the value in it.
 We used these array to store multiple data at a time into single variable.
 This will reduce the code length and increase the reuseablity
 Array is having 2 types:1.soingle dimensional array
					     2.Multi dimentional array
						 
						 
						 
						 

2.4.Write program given array number[]={23,45,67,8,12,3,7,9,102,34,4,5}
   Count the number of prime numbers in the given array:
     
	 

   
	class Prime
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int n = {23,45,67,8,12,3,7,9,102,34,4,5};
		for(int i=0;i<n.length;i++)
		{
			Syatem.out.println("array length is" +n.length);
			if(n % 2 == 0)
		{
			System.out.println("The number is not prime and even");
	    }
		else{
	     System.out.println("The number is prime not even");
	  
	  }
	  
	  
	}

}
   
   
   
   
   
   
2.5.Explain the dat types in java give examples for each:
	Data type is are used to indicate the type of data we are storing in a variable
	These will helps the memory allocaton of data
	Their are 2 types in datatypes are:
		1.Premitive data type:ex:byte,int,float,char,bit,double,char,bool.
		2.Non premitive data types:class,string,array,etc
		
			
			
			
			
		
2.6.Explain the variable with example
	These are the registered area allocated in the memory.
types of varibale:
1.	Local variable: variable declared inside main ,inside constructor, inside block called local variables.(main is method).
Declaration and initialization is must.
  2. static variable: variables declared with static word called static 
     Variable.
Declaration is done but no initialization of variable.
3. instance/non static variable: variables declared outside main, outside 
   constructor  outside but inside class.
4.	parameters:

Variable is getting stored in stack but data is getting stored in heap of java memory.






7.What is constructor when is the class constructor invoked will a class contain multiple constructor explain types with examples:
	Constructor is special type of method which will be same name as class with no written type 
	Helpful by using new to create the object.
	Every class had constructor mandatorily.
	If we wont create java constructor under java compiler will create constructor for our class if we wonâ€™t create


8.Explain java features:
Simple and easy:doesnt use pointer and header
platform independent:
Dynamic:have capablity to link classes methods and object 
Object oriented:no coding outside object
high performance:jvm execute byte code very fast
portable :easy to carry
interpreted byte code interpreted by jvm increase security 
distributed:provide network facility http ftp
secure:access ristrictions by access modifiers
robust:inbuilt capacity to handle errors
platform independent:java can executed with any platforms just have the jre in it



9.What gives java its 'write once and run anywhere'nature
portable nature of java 
platform independent nature

10.What is the purpose of static method and variables
	Static members (variables and methods) are class members Where as Instance members are object members.
	Static VS Instance:
	Static members access with class name instance members are accessed by reference.
	Instance get loaded in memory after creating the object where as static members will get loaded into memory along with the class name.


11.What is the purpose of default constructor
	Constructor which is written by compiler is called as default constructor.
	Constructor access modifier most recommended is public.
	Instance variable can be access with the help of reference variables.


12.Write a program to reverse  given number
ex: 1234

Class Riverse{
public static void main(String a[]{
int a=1234,b;
int c=0;
while(a>0)
{
b=a%10;
a=a/10;
c=(c*10)+b;
}
System.out.print("reverse is" +c);
}

}


13.Write a program to give the factorial of a number:

class Factorial{

     public static void main(String args[]){
	 
	 int num = 10;
	 
	 long factorial = 1;
	 
	 for(int i = 1; i <= num; i++){
	 
	    factorial *= i;
	}
	
	System.out.printf("Factorial of %d=%d", num, factorial);
	 
   }

}

14.Write a program to get the sum of digits:234
 Class Sum1{
 public static void main(String a[]){
 int a=234;
 int x,sum=0;

 while (a>0)
 {
 x=a%10;
 sum=sum+x;
 n=n/10;
 }
 System.out.println("sum of digits:" +sum);
 }
}
