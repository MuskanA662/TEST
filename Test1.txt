1.Java is a platform independent beacause it will perform its opeartions in any platform like it doesnt 
 depends on any software or hardware Because once the Program is written it will be converted from source 
 code into byte code by the help of compiler that byte code can be executed at any platforms just it need
 a jre(Java runtime environment) in it.Platform independent java langauge is more efficient than other 
 langauges because we can use it in any platform where we want.
 
 
2.Premitive and Non premitive:
	Total 8 types of premitive datat types are their and are:
	 int,float,char,boolean,byte,bit,double,short.
	 All premitive starts with lower case.
	 These will always have short names.
 
	Non-premitive data types are many and are: String,class,reference types
	All non primitive starts with uppercase.
	
3.Class and its members:
	Class is a design which contain .
	Object is an instance of class.
	Their are two members of class :static and instance:
	Static members (variables and methods) are class members Where as Instance members are object members.

4.	class Marks
{
	public static void main(String arg[])
	{
	int total=100;
	int recieved=76;
	int percentage;
	System.out.println("The percentage is:");
	if(total<recieved)
	{
	percentage=(recieved/total)*100;
	System.out.println(percentage);

	}


}}



5.Remove duplicate in an below array:





6.Explain the main method with the memory it executes in
	Methods are collection of statements that are grouped together to perform any (operation) functionality.
	Number of arguments should match with number of parameters of the method.
	Main method is the first method which used to get executed in the program 
	main method starts with lower case it will start the program
	Their are 2 types of methods:static and instance

  

7.Reverse number program:
	class ReverseNumber
	{
		public static void main(String args[])
		{
		int num = 1234, rev = 0;
		System.out.println("Original number : " + num);
		while(num != 0)
		{
			int digit = num % 10;
			rev = rev * 10 + digit;
			num = num / 10;  
		}
		System.out.println("Rev number : " + rev);  
	   }
	}
	
	
	
	
	
	
8.Program to find hours into seconds
class clock
{
public static void main(String a[])
{
int hours =3;
int minutes;
int seconds;
System.out.println("Converting hours into seconds");
if (hours<24)
{
	seconds=hours*3600;

}
System.out.println("Converting hours into seconds", hours);
}
}








9.	Program to find armstrong number:



	class armstrong
	{
	public static void main (String a[])
	{
	int number = 276,realNumber,reminder,result=0;
	realNumber=number;
	while(original number!=0)
	{
	reminder = realNumber%10;
	result= math.pow(reminder,3);
	realNumber/=10;
	}
	if(result== number)
	system.out.println(number+"is an  armstrong number");
	else
	system.out.println(number+"is an  armstrong number");
	}

	}
